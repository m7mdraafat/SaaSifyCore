# 🚀 SaaSifyCore  
### A modern, multi-tenant SaaS backend boilerplate built with **.NET 8** and **Azure**

---

## 🧩 What is SaaSifyCore?

**SaaSifyCore** isn’t just another backend project — it’s a **multi-tenant SaaS foundation** built with **.NET Clean Architecture**.  

Its core mission is to make it **extremely easy for developers or companies to launch new SaaS platforms quickly** — without rebuilding essential infrastructure such as:

- 🔑 Authentication & Authorization  
- 🏢 Tenant Management  
- 💳 Subscription & Payment Handling  
- ✉️ Email & Identity Verification  
- 🧾 Audit Logging  
- 🧱 Resource Isolation  

In essence, it’s a **SaaS boilerplate** — the *engine room* for any cloud-based application that serves multiple clients or organizations.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

To build a **ready-to-use SaaS backend template** that accelerates the development of modern, scalable cloud apps.  

SaaSifyCore provides secure authentication, tenant management, subscription handling, and developer productivity tools — allowing teams to **spin up SaaS products in weeks, not months.**
