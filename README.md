# SaaSifyCore
### A modern, multi-tenant SaaS backend boilerplate built with **.NET 9** and **Azure**

---

## What is SaaSifyCore?

**SaaSifyCore** isn’t just another backend project — it’s a **multi-tenant SaaS foundation** built with **.NET Clean Architecture**.  

Its core mission is to make it **extremely easy for developers or companies to launch new SaaS platforms quickly** — without rebuilding essential infrastructure such as:

- Authentication & Authorization  
- Tenant Management  
- Subscription & Payment Handling  
- Email & Identity Verification  
- Audit Logging  
- Resource Isolation  

In essence, it’s a **SaaS boilerplate** — the *engine room* for any cloud-based application that serves multiple clients or organizations.

---

## Project Vision

To build a **ready-to-use SaaS backend template** that accelerates the development of modern, scalable cloud apps.  

SaaSifyCore provides secure authentication, tenant management, subscription handling, and developer productivity tools — allowing teams to **spin up SaaS products in weeks, not months.**

| Authentication | **JWT + Refresh Tokens, OAuth 2.0** | Modern, secure, and easily extensible |
| Payments | **Stripe Integration** | Universal SaaS billing and subscription management |
| Cloud | **Azure App Service + Key Vault** | Secure, cloud-native deployment |
| Cache | **Redis** | Session and tenant-level caching |

- Tenant overview (name, plan, status, expiration)  
- Per-tenant user management  
- System metrics (active tenants, subscriptions, failed payments)  

### 5. Developer Experience
- Built-in seed data for rapid testing  
- Swagger UI for API exploration  
- Unit tests for core flows (Auth, Subscriptions, Tenant Isolation)
